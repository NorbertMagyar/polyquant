In this repository I am storing my Python scripts that I use to:
  - Download polygon.io historical stock data.
  - Analyze daily data, and download minute historical data for selected stocks.
  - Carry out intra-day buy/sell orders on selected stocks according to a specific strategy, with custom take-profit and stop-losses.
  - Plot daily P&L as histogram and print out total profits minus trading fees.
